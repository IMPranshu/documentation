This document describes tuning certain features of an application for high performance, 
the main focus is on content cluster search features, 
see <a href="container-tuning.html">Container tuning</a> for tuning of container clusters</a>.
The <a href="sizing-search.html">search sizing guide</a> is about scaling an application deployment.

<h2 id="attribute-vs-index">Attribute v.s index</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a> documentation summaries when to use
  <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#attribute">attribute</a>
  in the <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#indexing">indexing</a> statement.
  Also see the <a href="../operations/admin-procedures.html#schema-changes">procedure</a>
  for changing from attribute to index and vice-versa.
</p>
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing: summary | attribute
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
<p>
  If both index and attribute is configured for string type fields,
  Vespa will do search and matching against the index with default match <samp>text</samp>.
  All numeric type fields and tensor fields are attribute (in-memory) fields in Vespa.
</p>




<h2 id="when-to-use-fast-search">When to use fast-search for attribute fields</h2>
<p>
By default Vespa does not build any posting list index structures over <em>attribute</em> fields.
Adding <em>fast-search</em> to the attribute definition as shown below
will add an in-memory B-tree posting list structure
which enables faster search for some cases (but not all, see next paragraph):
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing:  summary | attribute
    attribute: fast-search
    rank:      filter
}
</pre>

<p>When Vespa executes a query with multiple query items it builds a query execution plan which it tries to 
optimize so that query tree items that are restrictive, meaning they match few documents, are evaluated early so 
that the temporary result set becomes as low as possible. 
To do so the query execution plan looks at hit count estimates for each part of the query tree using the index 
and B-tree dictionaries which track the number of documents a given term occurs in.
However, for attribute fields without fast-search there is no hit count estimate so the estimate becomes 
equal to the total number of documents (matches all) and is thus moved to the end of the query evaluation. 
A query with only one query term searching a attribute field without <em>fast-search</em> would be 
a linear scan over all documents and thus very slow:

<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100);
</pre>
But if this query term is <em>and</em>-ed with another term which matches fewer documents, that term will determine
the cost instead, and fast-search won't be necessary, for example:
<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100) and uuid contains "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000";
</pre>
The general rules of thumb for when to use fast-search for an attribute field is:
<ul>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field is searched without any other query terms</li>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field could limit the total number of hits efficiently</li>
</ul>
Changing fast-search aspect of the attribute is a
<a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#modifying-schemas">live change</a>
which does not require any re-feeding, so testing the performance with and without is low effort. 
Adding or removing <em>fast-search</em> requires restart.
</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-taat-daat">Hybrid TAAT (term-at-a-time) and DAAT (document-at-a-time) query evaluation</h2>
<p>
Generally Vespa does <em>DAAT</em> (document-at-a-time) query evaluation and not <em>TAAT</em> (term-at-a time) so ranking and matching is not 
fully two separate phases where one first find matches and later ranks them.
Matching and first-phase score calculation is interleaved when using DAAT. 
</p>

<p>The first-phase ranking score is assigned to the hit when it satisfies the query constraints and 
at that point the term iterators are positioned at the document id and one can unpack additional data from the term posting lists, 
for example for term proximity scoring used by <a href="../nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> ranking feature which also requires unpacking of positions of the term within the document.

Vespa can do a hybrid query evaluation combining TAAT and DAAT and using TAAT for sub-tree parts of the overall query tree which is not used for ranking, but used only for document filtering where 
unpacking of posting lists is not needed. With <em>rank:filter</em> on a per field basis one can avoid unpacking on a per term/field basis while the TAAT evaluation works overall for the query sub tree. 

Using TAAT can speed up query matching in some cases where the query tree is large and complex 
and where only small parts of the query tree is used for ranking hits or ranking by a ranking expression only using <a href="../tensor-user-guide.html">attribute or tensor</a> features.

For example for a query request where we take some user input from an end user by the userQuery() syntax 
and combine it with business logic filters. In this example a language constraint and a market constraint:
<pre>
{
  'hits': 10,
  'ranking.profile': text-and-popularity",
  'yql': 'select * from sources * where userQuery() and \
   (language contains "en" or language contains "br") and \
   (market contains "us" or market contains "eu" or market contains "apac" or market contains ".." ... ..... ..);'
  'query': 'cat video'
}
</pre>

With ranking profile <em>text-and-popularity</em> defined as 

<pre>
rank-profile text-and-popularity {
  first-phase {
    expression: attribute(popularity) + log10(bm25(title))
  }
}
</pre>

In this case the ranking profile only uses two signals, the popularity value and the <a href="../reference/bm25.html">bm25</a> score of the 
title as calculated from the input userQuery() terms. The language and the market constraints in the query tree are not used in the 
ranking score and that part of the query tree could be evaluated using <em>TAAT</em>.  The sub-tree result is then passed as a bit vector into the <em>DAAT</em>
 query evaluation which could speed up the overall evaluation. Enabling hybrid <em>TAAT</em> is done by passing <em>ranking.matching.termwiselimit=0.01</em> as a request parameter 
so one can evaluate if using the hybrid evaluation improves performance.

<h2 id="indexing-uuids">Indexing uuids</h2>

<p>When configuring <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#type:string">string</a>
type fields with <samp>index</samp>,
the default <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#match">match</a> mode is <samp>text</samp>.
This means Vespa will <a href="../linguistics.html#tokenization">tokenize</a> the content and index the tokens.</p>

<p>The string representation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">
Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) is 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits,
in five groups, separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12,
for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens).</p>

<p>Example: Indexing <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> with the above document definition,
Vespa will tokenize this into 5 tokens: <samp>[123e4567,e89b,12d3,a456,426655440000]</samp>, 
each of which could be matched independently, leading to possible incorrect matches.</p>

<p>To avoid this, change the mode to <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#word">match: word</a> to
treat the entire uuid as <i>one</i> token/word:
<pre>
field uuid type string {
    indexing: summary | index
    match:    word
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
In addition, configure the <samp>uuid</samp> as a
<a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#filter">rank: filter</a> field -
the field will then be represented as efficient as possible during search and ranking.</p>

<p>The <samp>rank:filter</samp> behavior can also be triggered at query time on a per query item basis
by the <samp>com.yahoo.prelude.query.Item.setRanked()</samp>
in a <a href="../searcher-development.html">custom searcher</a>.</p>


<h2 id="parent-child-and-search-performance">Parent child and search performance</h2>
<p>
When searching imported attribute fields from parent document types
there is an additional cost penalty which can be reduced significantly
if the imported field is defined with <samp>rank:filter</samp>
and <a href="../reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a> is configured to &gt; 0.
</p>



<h2 id="ranking-and-ml-model-inferences">Ranking and ML Model inferences</h2>
<p>
Vespa <a href="sizing-search.html">scales</a> with the number of hits the query retrieves per node/search thread,
and which needs to be evaluated by the first-phase ranking function.
Read more on <a href="../phased-ranking.html">phased ranking</a>.
Using phased ranking enables spending more resources during a second phase ranking step than in the first-phase.
The first-phase should be focused on getting decent recall (retrieve relevant documents in the top k),
while second phase is used to tune precision at k,
bringing the relevant documents to the top of the result set.
</p><p>
For <a href="../text-matching-ranking.html">text ranking</a> applications,
consider using the <a href="../using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND</a> query operator -
WAND can efficiently find the top k documents using a linear ranking function (inner dot product).
</p>



<h2 id="document-summaries-hits">Document summaries - hits</h2>
<p>
If queries request many hits from a few content nodes,
a <a href="caches-in-vespa.html">summary cache</a> might reduce latency and cost.
</p><p>
Using <a href="../document-summaries.html">Document summaries</a>,
Vespa can support memory-only operations if fields in the summary are defined as <em>attribute</em>.
</p>



<h2 id="boolean-numeric-text-attribute">Boolean, numeric, text attribute</h2>
<p>
When selecting attribute field type, considering performance, this is a rule of thumb:
<ol>
  <li>Use boolean if a field is a boolean (max two values)</li>
  <li>Use a string attribute if there is a set of values - only unique strings are stored</li>
  <li>Use a numeric attribute for range searches</li>
</ol>
Refer to <a href="../attributes.html">attributes</a> for details.
