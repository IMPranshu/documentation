title: "Profiling the Search Container"
---

<p>
This document describes how you can configure the Container to
allow for profiling custom searchers in order to identify performance bottlenecks -
be it lock contention or CPU intensive algorithms.
It also describes how to enable remote debugging using the IntelliJ IDEA.
</p>

<p>
Yourkit is a good and simple tool for finding hotspots in Java code.
It supports both sampling and tracing. Very often it is necessary to use both modes.
Tracing is accurate as to how many times a method is invoked and from where.
That can be used to analyze if you are actually not computing the same thing from multiple places
and overall doing more than you need.
However it will hide effects of cache miss
and especially cost of atomic operations and synchronization costs.
</p><p>
Assume there is an installation in a data center that you would like to profile,
preferably with a nice UI running on your local desktop.
All this is just a few steps away:
<ul>
  <li>Install yourkit</li> <!-- ToDo: better instructions here -->
  <li>Modify <em>services.xml</em>:
<pre>
&lt;nodes&gt;
  &lt;jvm options="-agentlib:yjpagent -Dvespa.freezedetector.disable=true" /&gt;
...
&lt;/nodes&gt;
</pre>
Read more about <a href="container-tuning.html">jvm tuning</a>.
Disabling the freezedetector stops the container from shutting down during profiling.</li>
  <li>Re-deploy the application:
<pre>
$ vespa-deploy prepare appdir &amp;&amp; vespa-deploy activate
</pre></li>
  <li>restart Vespa on the node that runs the Container</li>
</ul>
Browse <em>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa.log</em> for errors.
You are now ready to perform profiling;
you just need to install the UI on your desktop.
</p>



<h2 id="install-yourkit-ui-on-the-desktop">Install YourKit UI on the Desktop</h2>
<p>
The server is ready for profiling,
now install the YourKit profiler on the desktop.
Download the distribution that fits the OS you are running from
<a href="https://www.yourkit.com/">YourKit</a>.
Follow the installation instructions, including setting the
<em>license server</em>.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
By default the YourKit agent runs on port 10001.
If Vespa is running on hosts not directly reachable from the desktop,
setting up an SSH tunnel can work around:
<pre>
$ ssh -L 1080:$hostname:10001 $hostname
</pre>
<p>
Where <em>$hostname</em> is the node that is running the
container with the YourKit agent profiler.
All traffic to localhost (the desktop) port 1080 will be forwarded
to the remote application running on port 10001.
</p>



<h2 id="using">Using Yourkit</h2>
<p>
You are now ready to profile your application. (You will need to put
some realistic load against the container instance, please see
the <a href="vespa-benchmarking.html">Vespa benchmarking guide</a>)
After having started the load simulation you can start the profiling session,
open the YourKit application installed locally and chose <em>Monitor Remote
Applications =&gt; Connect to remote
application</em>. Enter <em>localhost:1080</em> and press
Connect. You should now see the profiling screen with <em>Remote
application "Server" (PID XXXXX) is being profiled at localhost:1080</em>.
</p>



<h2 id="remote-debug-with-intellij-idea">Remote debug with IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
<p>
  To remote debug the container, first set up a remote debugging configuration in the IDEA:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run -> Edit Configurations...</li>
  <li>Click "+" to add a new configuration.</li>
  <li>Select the "Remote JVM Debug" option in the left-most pane.</li>
  <li>Set hostname to the host running the container, change the port if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Next, set the container's <a href="../reference/services-container.html#jvm">jvm options</a>
  to the value in "Command line arguments for remote JVM".
  Insert the value verbatim in <em>services.xml</em>:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;container id="default" version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;nodes&gt;
    &lt;jvm options="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005" /&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/nodes&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Re-deploy the application, then restart Vespa on the node that runs the container.
  Start debugging, check <em>vespa.log</em> for errors.
</p>
