title: "Container Tuning"

<p>
A collection of configuration parameters to tune the Container as used in Vespa.
Some configuration parameters have native
<a href="../cloudconfig/application-packages.html">services.xml</a> support
while others are configured through
<a href="../reference/config-files.html#generic-configuration-in-services-xml">
generic config overrides</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="container-worker-threads">Container worker threads</h2>
<p>
    Most handlers use the jdisc default threadpool, which is controlled by a central Executor provider.
    Some built-in handlers have separate threadpools, e.g search handler and http-client-api handler.
    Do note that e.g. federation will spawn off extra worker threads separate from the search handler threadpool.
    The default threadpool configuration can be overridden using the <em>config</em> element for <i>container.handler.threadpool</i> in services.xml
    Handlers with dedicated threapools have separate syntax in services.xml (see example below).
</p>
<p>
    The jdisc threadpools will pre-start the worker threads (<em>min-threads</em>), so even an idle container will report running several hundred threads.
    Note that tuning the capacity upwards increases the risk of high GC pressure
    as concurrency becomes higher with more in-flight requests.
    The GC pressure is a function of number of in-flight requests,
    the time it takes to complete the request
    and the amount of garbage produced per request.
    Increasing the queue size will allow the application to handle shorter traffic bursts without rejecting requests,
    although increasing the average latency for those requests that are queued up.
    Large queues will also increase heap consumption in overload situations.
    Extra threads will be created once the queue is full (if <em>max-threads &gt; min-threads</em>), and are destroyed after an idle timeout.
<p>
<pre>
&lt;container id="container" version="1.0"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;search&gt;
    &lt;threadpool&gt;
      &lt;max-threads&gt;500&lt;/max-threads&gt;
      &lt;min-threads&gt;500&lt;/min-threads&gt;
      &lt;queue-size&gt;0&lt;/queue-size&gt;
    &lt;/threadpool&gt;
  &lt;/search&gt;
  ...
  &lt;document-api&gt;
    &lt;http-client-api&gt;
      &lt;threadpool&gt;
        &lt;max-threads&gt;50&lt;/max-threads&gt;
        &lt;min-threads&gt;10&lt;/min-threads&gt;
        &lt;queue-size&gt;1000&lt;/queue-size&gt;
      &lt;/threadpool&gt;
    &lt;/http-client-api&gt;
  &lt;/document-api&gt;
  ...
  &lt;config name="container.handler.threadpool"&gt;
    &lt;maxthreads&gt;200&lt;/maxthreads&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
  ...
&lt;/container&gt;
</pre>
Handlers which are injected with an Executor in their constructor
will share threads from the same threadpool.
Number of threads is active is available as
<a href="../reference/metrics.html#http-server-metrics">serverActiveThreads</a> metric.
If all threads are occupied, requests are denied with 503.
</p>



<h2 id="jvm-heap-size">JVM heap size</h2>
<p>
Change the default JVM heap size settings used by Vespa to better suit
the specific hardware settings or application requirements.
</p><p>
By setting the relative size of the total JVM heap in
<a href="../reference/services-container.html#nodes">percentage of available memory</a>,
one does not know exactly what the heap size will be,
but the configuration will be adaptable
and ensure that the container can start
even in environments with less available memory.
The example below allocates 50% of available memory on the machine to the JVM heap:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;container id="container" version="1.0"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;nodes&gt;
    &lt;jvm allocated-memory="50%" /&gt;
    &lt;node hostalias="node0" /&gt;
  &lt;/nodes&gt;
  ...

&lt;/container&gt;
</pre>



<h2 id="jvm-tuning">JVM Tuning</h2>
<p>
Use <em>gc-options</em> for controlling GC related parameters
and <em>options</em> for tuning other parameters.
See <a href="../reference/services-container.html#nodes">reference documentation</a>.
Example: Running with 4GB heap using G1 garbage collector and using NewRatio = 1
(equal size of old and new generation) and enabling verbose GC logging (logged to stdout to
vespa.log file).
<pre>
&lt;container id="default" version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;nodes&gt;
    &lt;jvm gc-options="-Xms4g -Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=15 -XX:NewRatio=1 -XX:+PrintGC" options="-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags" /&gt;
    &lt;node hostalias="node0" /&gt;
  &lt;/nodes&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;
</pre>
<p>The default heap size with docker image is 1.5g which can for high throughput applications be on the low side, causing frequent
  garbage collection. By default the G1GC collector is used, for some applications one might get better throughput and lower latency
  by changing to the deprecated CMS collector.</p>


<h3 id="config-server-and-config-proxy">Config Server and Config Proxy</h3>
<p>
The config server and proxy are not executed based on the model in <em>services.xml</em>.
On the contrary, they are used to bootstrap the services in that model.
Consequently, one must use configuration variables
to set the JVM parameters for the config server and config proxy.
They also need to be restarted (<em>services</em> in the config proxy's case) after a change,
but one does <em>not</em> need to <em>vespa-deploy prepare</em>
or <em>vespa-deploy activate</em> first. Example:
<pre>
VESPA_CONFIGSERVER_JVMARGS      -verbose:gc
VESPA_CONFIGPROXY_JVMARGS       -verbose:gc -Xmx256m
</pre>
Refer to <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html">Setting Vespa variables</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="container-warmup">Container warmup</h2>
<p>
Some applications observe that the first queries made to a freshly started container
take a long time to complete.
This is typically due to some components performing lazy setup of data structures or connections.
Lazy initialization should be avoided in favor of eager initialization in component constructor,
but this is not always possible.
A way to avoid problems with the first queries in such cases
is to perform warmup queries at startup.
This is done by issuing queries from the constructor of the Handler of regular queries.
If you are using the default handler, com.yahoo.search.handler.SearchHandler,
you need to subclass this and configure your subclass as the handler of query requests in services.xml.
</p><p>
Add a call to a warmupQueries() method as the last line of your handler constructor.
The method can look something like this:
<pre>
private void warmupQueries() {
    String[] requestUris = new String[] {"warmupRequestUri1", "warmupRequestUri2"};
    int warmupIterations = 50;

    for (int i = 0; i < warmupIterations; i++) {
        for (String requestUri : requestUris) {
            handle(HttpRequest.createTestRequest(requestUri, com.yahoo.jdisc.http.HttpRequest.Method.GET));
        }
    }
}
</pre>
Since these queries will be executed before the container starts accepting external queries,
they will cause the first external queries to observe a warmed up container instance.
</p>
