<p>
Vespa provides metrics integration with CloudWatch, Datadog and Prometheus / Grafana,
as well as a JSON HTTP API.
See <a href="monitoring-with-grafana-quick-start.html">monitoring with Grafana quick start</a>
if you just want to get started monitoring your system.
</p>

<p>
There are two main approaches to transfer metrics to an external system:
<ul>
  <li>Have the external system <em>pull</em> metrics from Vespa</li>
  <li>Make Vespa <em>push</em> metrics to the external system</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pulling-metrics-from-vespa">Pulling metrics from Vespa</h2>
<p>
All pull-based solutions use Vespa's <a href="reference/metrics.html#metrics-api">metrics API</a>,
which provides metrics in JSON format, either for the full system or for a single node. 
The polling frequency should be limited to max once every 30 seconds as more frequent polling would
not give increased granularity but only lead to unnecessary load on your systems.

<tr id="pulling-into-cloudwatch">
  <th>CloudWatch</th>
  <td><p>
    Metrics can be pulled into CloudWatch from both <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">Vespa Cloud</a> and self-hosted Vespa.
    The recommended solution is to use an AWS lambda function, as described in
    <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/metrics-emitter/tree/master/cloudwatch">
    Pulling Vespa metrics to Cloudwatch</a>.
  </p></td>
</tr><tr id="pulling-into-datadog">
  <th>Datadog</th>
  <td><p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This method currently works for self-hosted Vespa only.
    </p><p>
    The Vespa team has created a Datadog Agent integration
    to allow real-time monitoring of Vespa in Datadog.
    The <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/vespa/">Datadog Vespa</a> integration
    is not packaged with the agent, but is included in Datadog's
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras">integrations-extras</a> repository.
    Clone it and follow the steps in the
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/vespa/README.md">README</a>.
  </p></td>
</tr><tr id="pulling-into-prometheus">
  <th>Prometheus</th>
  <td><p>
    Vespa exposes metrics in a text based
    <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">format</a> that can be
    scraped by <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">Prometheus</a>.
    For <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">Vespa Cloud</a>, append <em>/prometheus/v1/values</em>
    to your endpoint URL. For self-hosted Vespa the URL is:
    <em>http://&lt;container-host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/prometheus/v1/values</em>, where
    the <em>port</em> is the same as for searching, e.g. 8080. Metrics for each individual host
    can also be retrieved at <code>http://host:19092/prometheus/v1/values</code>.
    </p><p>
    See the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quick-start</a> for a Prometheus / Grafana example.

<h2 id="pushing-metrics-to-cloudwatch">Pushing metrics to CloudWatch</h2>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This method currently works for self-hosted Vespa only.
</p><p>
This is presumably the most convenient way to monitor Vespa in CloudWatch.
Steps / requirements:
<ol>
  <li>An IAM user or IAM role that only has the <em>putMetricData</em> permission.</li>
  <li>Store the credentials for the above user or role in a
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/create-shared-credentials-file.html">
    shared credentials file</a> on each Vespa node.
    If a role is used, provide a mechanism to keep the credentials file updated when keys are rotated.</li>
  <li>Configure Vespa to push metrics to CloudWatch -
    example configuration for the <a href="reference/services-admin.html">admin</a> section in <em>services.xml</em>:
<pre>
&lt;metrics&gt;
    &lt;consumer id="my-cloudwatch"&gt;
      &lt;metric-set id="default" /&gt;
      &lt;cloudwatch region="us-east-1" namespace="my-vespa-metrics"&gt;
          &lt;shared-credentials file="/path/to/credentials-file" /&gt;
      &lt;/cloudwatch&gt;
    &lt;/consumer&gt;
&lt;/metrics&gt;
</pre>
    This configuration sends the default set of Vespa metrics to the CloudWatch namespace
    <code>my-vespa-metrics</code> in the <code>us-east-1</code> region.
    Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/vespa/metadata.csv">metric list</a>
    for <code>default</code> metric set.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
