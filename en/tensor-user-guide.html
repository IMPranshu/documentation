<p>
Vespa provides a tensor data model and computation engine to support advanced computations over data,
such as for example computing neural network ranking models.
In this guide, tensors are introduced with some examples of use.

<h2 id="tensor-document-fields">Tensor document fields</h2>
<p>
In typical use, a document contains one or more <em>tensor fields</em> to be used for ranking -
this example sets up a tensor field called <code>tensor_attribute</code>:
<pre>
field tensor_attribute type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[4]) {
    indexing: attribute | summary
}
</pre>
A tensor requires a type - <code>x[4]</code> means <em>indexed</em> dimension of size 4,
where <code>x{}</code> means <em>mapped</em> dimension - see
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:tensor">tensor field</a> in schemas.
For details on tensor types, refer to the
<a href="reference/tensor.html#tensor-type-spec">tensor type reference</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="feeding-tensors">Feeding tensors</h2>
<p>
There are two options when feeding tensors.
<ul>
  <li>Convert some other field, for instance a vector of floats,
    to a tensor during document processing using the
    <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/vespajlib/latest/com/yahoo/tensor/Tensor.html">tensor Java API</a>.</li>
  <li>Feed tensors using the <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor">
    tensor JSON format</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Tensors can be updated - one can
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor-add">add</a>,
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor-remove">remove</a> and
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor-modify">modify</a> tensor cells, or
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor-field">assign</a>
a completely new tensor value.
</p>



<h2 id="querying-with-tensors">Querying with tensors</h2>
<p>
Tensors can only be used for <em>ranking</em>, not searching.
The tensor can either be supplied in the query request,
or constructed from some other data or data source.
In the latter case, refer to the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/vespajlib/latest/com/yahoo/tensor/Tensor.html">Tensor</a>
Java API for details on how to construct tensors programmatically. Query/Context tensors must be defined in the application package (name, type and dimension),
see <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#query-feature-types">defining query feature types</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="ranking-with-tensors">Ranking with tensors</h2>
<p>
Tensors are used during ranking to modify a document's rank score given the query.
Typical operations are dot products between tensors of order 1 (vectors),
or matrix products between tensors of order 2 (matrices).
Tensors are used in <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">rank expressions</a> as rank features.
Two rank features are defined above:
<ul>
    <li><code>attribute(tensor_attribute)</code>: the tensor associated with the document</li>
    <li><code>query(tensor)</code>: the tensor sent with the query request</li>
</ul>
These can be used in rank expressions.
Note that the final rank score of a document must be a single double value - example</a>:
<pre>
rank-profile dot_product {
    first-phase {
        expression: sum(query(tensor)*attribute(tensor_attribute))
    }
}
</pre>
This takes the product of the query tensor and the document tensor, and sums
all fields thus resolving into a single value which is used as the rank score.
In the case above, the value is 39.0 (1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 5*5).
</p><p>
There are some <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html#primitive-functions">ranking functions</a>
that are specific for tensors:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>map(tensor, f(x)(...))</td> <td>Returns a new tensor with the lambda function defined in <code>f(x)(...)</code> applied to each cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap;">reduce(tensor, aggregator, dim1, dim2, ...)</td> <td>Returns a new tensor with the <code>aggregator</code> applied across dimensions dim1, dim2, etc. If no dimensions are specified, reduce over all dimensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>join(tensor1, tensor2, f(x,y)(...))</td> <td>Returns a new tensor constructed from the <em>natural join</em> between <code>tensor1</code> and <code>tensor2</code>, with the resulting cells having the value as calculated from <code>f(x,y)(...)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the cell value from <code>tensor1</code> and <code>y</code> from <code>tensor2</code>.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
These primitives allow for a great deal of flexibility when combined. The above rank expression is equivalently:
<pre>
rank-profile dot_product {
    first-phase {
        expression {
            reduce(
                join(
                    query(tensor),
                    attribute(tensor_attribute),
                    f(x,y)(x * y)
                ),
                sum
            )
        }
    }
}
</pre>
...and represents the general dot product for tensors of any order.
Details about tensor ranking functions including lambda expression and available aggregators
can be found in the <a href="reference/tensor.html">tensor reference documentation</a>.
</p><p>
Create a tensor on the fly from another field type:
<ul>
  <li>From a single-valued source field:
<pre>
tensor(x{}):{x1:attribute(foo)}
</pre></li>
  <li>Create a tensor in the ranking function from arrays or weighted sets using <code>tensorFrom...</code> functions - see
    <a href="reference/rank-features.html#document-features">document features.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2 id="performance-considerations">Performance considerations</h2>
<p class="alert alert-success">
Tensor expressions are fairly concise, and since the expressions themselves
are independent of the data size, the actual workload during ranking can be significant
for large tensors.
</p><p>
When using tensors in ranking it is important to have an understanding of the
potential computational cost for each query. As an example, assume
the dot product of two tensors with 1000 values each, e.g. <code>tensor&lt;double&gt;(x[1000])</code>.
Assuming one query tensor and one document tensor, the operation is:
<pre>
sum(query(tensor1) * attribute(tensor2))
</pre>
If 8 bytes is used to store each value (e.g. using a double), each tensor is approximately 8KB.
With for instance <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/81055/intel-xeon-processor-e52683-v3-35m-cache-2-00-ghz.html">a Haswell architecture</a>
the theoretical upper memory bandwidth is 68GB/s, which is around 9 million
document ranking evaluations per second. With 1 million documents, this means
the maximum throughput, with regards to pure memory bandwidth, is 9 queries per second (per node).
</p><p>
Even though you would typically not do the above without reducing the
search space first (using matching and first phase), it is important to consider
the memory bandwidth and other hardware limitations when developing ranking expressions with tensors.
</p>
<h3 id="cell-value-types">Performance considerations for cell value types</h3>
<table class="table">
  <tr id="double">
    <th>double</th>
    <td>
      The 64-bit floating-point "double"
      format is the default cell type.  It gives best precision at
      the cost of high memory usage and somewhat slower calculations.
      Using a smaller value type increases performance, trading off
      precision, so consider changing to one of the cell types below
      before scaling your application.
    </td>
  </tr><tr id="float">
    <th>float</th>
    <td>
      The usual 32-bit floating-point format "float" should usually
      be used for all tensors when scaling for production.
      (Note that other frameworks, like tensorflow, will also prefer 32-bit floats.)
      A vector with 1000 dimensions, <code>tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[1000])</code> would then
      use approx 4K memory per tensor value.
    </td>
  </tr><tr id="bfloat16">
    <th>bfloat16</th>
    <td>
      <p>
      If memory (or memory bandwidth) is still a concern, it's
      possible to change the most space-consuming tensors to use
      the <code>bfloat16</code> cell type.  This type has the range
      as a normal 32-bit float but only 8 bits of precision, and
      can be thought of as "float with lossy compression".  See also
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format">bfloat16
      floating-point format</a> on Wikipedia.  Some careful analysis
      of your data is required before using this type.
      </p><p>
      Note that when doing calculations <code>bfloat16</code> will act as if
      it was a 32-bit float, but the smaller size comes with a potential
      computation overhead. In most cases, the <code>bfloat16</code> needs
      to be converted to a 32-bit float before the actual calculation can
      take place; adding an extra conversion step.
      </p><p>
      In some cases, having tensors with <code>bfloat16</code> cells might
      bypass some build-in optimizations in the back-end (like matrix
      multiplication) that will be hardware accelerated only if the cells
      are the same type.  To avoid this last case, you can use the
      <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html#cell_cast">cell_cast</a>
      tensor operation to make sure the cells are of the
      appropriate type before doing the more expensive operations.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr><tr id="int8">
    <th>int8</th>
    <td>
      If one uses machine-learning to generate a model with data
      quantization you can target the <code>int8</code> cell value
      type, which is a signed integer with range from -128 to +127 only.
      This is also treated like a "float with limited range and lossy
      compression" by the Vespa tensor framework, and gives results as if it
      was a 32-bit float when any calculation is done.  This type is also
      suitable when representing boolean values (0 or 1).  Note that if the input
      for an <code>int8</code> cell is not directly representable, the
      resulting cell value is undefined, so you should take care to only
      input numbers in the <code>[-128,127]</code> range.
      It's also possible to use <code>int8</code> representing binary
      data for <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">hamming distance</a>
      Nearest-Neighbor search.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="constant-tensors">Constant tensors</h2>
<p>
In addition to document tensors and query tensors,
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#constant">constant tensors</a>
can be put in the <a href="reference/application-packages-reference.html">application package</a>.
This is useful when constant tensors are used in ranking expressions,
for instance machine learned models. Example:
<pre>
constant tensor_constant {
    file: constants/constant_tensor_file.json
    type: tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[4])
}
</pre>
This defines a new tensor rank feature with the type as defined and the
contents distributed with the application package in the file
<em>constants/constant_tensor_file.json</em>. The format of this file is the
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor">tensor JSON format</a>, it can be compressed,
see the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#constant">reference</a> for examples.
</p><p>
To use this tensor in a rank expression, encapsulate the constant name with <code>constant(...)</code>:

<pre>
rank-profile use_constant_tensor {
    first-phase {
        expression: sum(query(tensor) * attribute(tensor_attribute) * constant(tensor_constant))
    }
}
</pre>
The above expression combines three tensors: the query tensor, the document tensor and a constant tensor.

<h2 id="tensor-concepts">Tensor concepts</h2>

<p>
In Vespa, a tensor is a data structure which is a generalization of scalars, vectors and matrices.
Tensors can have any order:
<ul>
    <li>A scalar is a tensor of order 0</li>
    <li>A vector is a tensor of order 1</li>
    <li>A matrix is a tensor of order 2</li>
</ul>
Tensors consist of a set of double valued cells, with each cell having a unique address.
A cell's address is specified by its index or label along all dimensions.
The number of dimensions in a tensor is the <em>rank</em> of the tensor.
Each dimension can be either <em>mapped</em> or <em>indexed</em>.
Mapped dimensions are sparse and allow any label (string identifier) designating their address,
while indexed dimensions use dense numberic indices starting at 0.
</p><p>
Example: Using <a href="reference/tensor.html#tensor-literal-form">literal form</a>, the tensor:
<pre>
{
    {x:2, y:1}:1.0,
    {x:0, y:2}:1.0
}
</pre>
has two dimensions named <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and has two cells with defined values:
</p>
<img src="img/tensor-guide.png" alt="Tensor graphical representation" />
<p>
A type declaration is needed for tensors. This defines a 2-dimensional mapped tensor (matrix) of float:
<pre>
tensor&lt;float&gt;(x{},y{})
</pre>
This is a 2-dimensional indexed tensor (a 2x3 matrix) of double:
<pre>
tensor&lt;double&gt;(x[2],y[3])
</pre>
A combination of mapped and indexed dimensions is a mixed tensor:
<pre>
tensor&lt;float&gt;(x{},y[3])
</pre>

<p>Vespa uses the type information to optimize execution plans at configuration time.
For dense data the best performance is achieved with indexed dimensions.</p>
