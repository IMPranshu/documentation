<p>
Proton is Vespa's search core. Proton maintains disk and memory structures for documents.
As the data is dynamic, these structures are periodically optimized by <a href="#proton-maintenance-jobs">maintenance jobs</a> and the resource footprint
of these background jobs are 
mainly controlled by the <a href="reference/services-content.html#feeding-concurrency">concurrency</a> setting.

<h2 id="internal-structure">Internal structure</h2>
<p>
The internal structure of a <em>proton node</em>:
</p><img src="content/img/proton_feed.png" alt="Proton overview"/><p>
The search node consists of a <em>bucket management system</em> which
sends requests to a set of <em>document databases</em>, which each
consists of three <em>sub-databases</em>.
</p>


<h3 id="bucket-management">Bucket management</h3>
<p>
When the node starts up it first needs to get an overview of what documents and hence buckets it has.
Once it knows this, it is in initializing mode, able to handle load,
but distributors do not yet know bucket metadata for all the buckets,
and thus can't know whether buckets are consistent with copies on other nodes.
Once metadata for all buckets are known, the content nodes transitions from
initializing to up state.
As the distributors wants quick access to bucket metadata,
it keeps an in-memory bucket database to efficiently serve these requests.
</p><p>
It implements elasticity support in terms of the SPI.
Operations are ordered according to priority,
and only one operation per bucket can be in-flight at a time.
Below bucket management is the persistence engine,
which implements the SPI in terms of Vespa search.
The persistence engine reads the document type from the document id,
and dispatches requests to the correct document database.
</p>


<h3 id="document-database">Document database</h3>
<p>
Each document database is responsible for a single document type.
It has a component called FeedHandler which takes care of incoming documents, updates, and remove requests.
All requests are first written to a <a href="#transaction-log">transaction log</a>,
then handed to the appropriate sub-database, based on the request type.
</p>


<h3 id="sub-databases">Sub-databases</h3>
<p>
There are three types of sub-databases, each with its own
<a href="attributes.html#document-meta-store">document meta store</a> and
<a href="document-summaries.html#document-store">document store</a>.
The document meta store holds a map from the document id to a local
id. This local id is used to address the document in the document
store. The document meta store also maintains information on the
state of the buckets that are present in the sub-database.
</p><p>
The sub-databases are maintained by the <em>index maintainer</em>.
The document distribution changes as the system is resized.
When the number of nodes in the system changes,
the index maintainer will move documents between the Ready and
Not Ready sub-databases to reflect the new distribution.
When an entry in the Removed sub-database gets old it is purged.
The sub-databases are:
<table class="table">

      <th style="white-space:nowrap;">Not Ready</th>
      <td>
        Holds the redundant documents that are not searchable,
        i.e. the <em>not ready</em> documents.
        Documents that are not ready are only stored, not indexed.
        It takes some processing to move from this state to the ready state.
      </td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>Ready</th>
      <td>
        Maintains an index of all <em>ready</em> documents and keeps them searchable.

          <tr>
            <th>Active</th>
            <td>There should always be exactly one active copy of each
            document in the system, though intermittently there may be more.

            <td>The ready copies that are not active are indexed but will not produce results.

        </table>
      </td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>Removed</th>
      <td>Keeps track of documents that have been removed.
        The id and timestamp for each document is kept.
        This information is used when buckets from two nodes are merged.
        If the removed document exists on another node but with a different timestamp,
        the most recent entry prevails.

<h2 id="transaction-log">Transaction log</h2>
<p>
Content nodes have a transaction log to persist mutating operations.
The transaction log persists operations by file append.
Having a transaction log simplifies proton's in-memory index structures
and enables steady-state high performance, read more below.
</p><p>
Operations are written immediately.
Flush jobs (below) sync the transaction log, for consistency.
</p><p>
Default, proton will
<a href="reference/services-content.html#flush-on-shutdown">flush components</a>
like attribute vectors and memory index on shutdown, for quicker startup.
</p>



<h2 id="index">Index</h2>
<p>
  Index fields are string fields, used for text search.
  Other field types are <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>
  and <a href="document-summaries.html">summary fields</a>.
</p>
<p>
Proton stores position information in text indices by default, for proximity relevance -
<em>posocc</em> (below).
All the occurrences of a term is stored in the posting list, with its position.
This provides superior ranking features,
but is somewhat more expensive than just storing a single occurrence per document.
For most applications it is the correct tradeoff,
since most of the cost is usually elsewhere and relevance is valuable.
</p><p>
Applications that only need occurrence information for filtering
can use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank">rank: filter</a>
to optimize performance, using only <em>boolocc</em>-files (below).
</p><p>
The memory index has a dictionary per index field.
This contains all unique words in that field with mapping to posting lists with position information.
The position information is used during ranking, see
<a href="nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> for details on how a text match score is calculated.
</p><p>
The disk index stores the content of each index field in separate folders.
Each folder contains:
<ul>
    <li>Dictionary. Files: <em>dictionary.pdat</em>, <em>dictionary.spdat</em>, <em>dictionary.ssdat</em>.</li>
    <li>Compresssed posting lists with position information. File: <em>posocc.dat.compressed</em>.</li>
    <li>Posting lists with only occurrence information (bitvector). These are generated for common words.
        Files: <em>boolocc.bdat</em>, <em>boolocc.idx</em>.</li>
</ul>
Example: <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/search/cluster.name/n1/documents/doc/0.ready/index/index.flush.1/my_index_field</em>

<h2 id="proton-maintenance-jobs">Proton maintenance jobs</h2>
<p>
Tune the jobs in <a href="reference/services-content.html">Proton tuning</a>.
<a href="performance/sizing-search.html">Sizing search</a> describes the <em>static</em> proton sizing -
this article details the <em>temporary</em> resource usage for the proton jobs.
</p><p>
There is only one instance of each job at a time - e.g. attributes are flushed in sequence.
When a job is running, its metric is set to 1 - otherwise 0.
Use this to correlate observed performance with job runs - see <em>Run metric</em>.

    When the content node receives a get request,
    it scans through all the document databases,

    Once the document is found, the scan is stopped and the document returned.
    If the document is found in a Ready sub-database,

  Queries has a separate pathway through the system.

  How queries move through the system:
</p><img src="content/img/elastic-query.svg" height="320" width="270"/><p>
  A query enters the system through the <em>QR-server (query rewrite server)</em>
  in the <a href="jdisc/">Vespa Container</a>.
  The QR-server issues one query per document type to the search nodes:
  <table class="table">

  in which case the container will send the query only to the specified document types.
</p><p>
  It sends the query to content nodes and collect partial results.
  It pings all content nodes every second to know whether they are alive,
  and keeps open TCP connections to each one.
