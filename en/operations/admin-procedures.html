<h2 id="process-pid-files">Process PID files</h2>
<p>
  All Vespa processes have a PID file <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/run/{service name}.pid</em>,
  where <em>{service name}</em> is the Vespa service name, e.g. <em>container</em> or <em>distributor</em>.
  It is the same name which is used in the administration interface
  in the <a href="../config-sentinel.html">config sentinel</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Learn how to <a href="../reference/files-processes-and-ports.html#vespa-start-stop">start / stop</a> nodes.
</p>



<h2 id="status-pages">Status pages</h2>
<p>
Vespa service instances have status pages for debugging and testing.
Status pages are subject to change at any time - take care when automating. Procedure:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Find the port:</strong>
    The status pages runs on ports assigned by Vespa. To find status page ports,
    use <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a>
    to list the services run in the application.
<pre>
$ vespa-model-inspect services
</pre>
    To find the status page port for a specific node for a specific service,
    pick the correct service and run:
<pre>
$ vespa-model-inspect service [Options] &lt;service-name&gt;
</pre>
  </li><li>
    <strong>Get the status and metrics:</strong>
    <em>distributor</em>, <em>storagenode</em>, <em>searchnode</em> and
    <em>container-clustercontroller</em> are content services with status pages.
    These ports are tagged HTTP. The cluster controller have multiple ports tagged HTTP,
    where the port tagged STATE is the one with the status page.
    Try connecting to the root at the port, or /state/v1/metrics.
    The <em>distributor</em> and <em>storagenode</em> status pages are available at <code>/</code>:
<pre>
$ vespa-model-inspect service searchnode
  searchnode @ myhost.mydomain.com : search
  search/search/cluster.search/0
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19110 (STATUS ADMIN RTC RPC)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19111 (FS4)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19112 (TEST HACK SRMP)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19113 (ENGINES-PROVIDER RPC)
  <span style="background-color: yellow;">tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19114 (HEALTH JSON HTTP)</span>
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19114/state/v1/metrics
  ...
  $ vespa-model-inspect service distributor
  distributor @ myhost.mydomain.com : content
  search/distributor/0
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19116 (MESSAGING)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19117 (STATUS RPC)
  <span style="background-color: yellow;">tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19118 (STATE STATUS HTTP)</span>
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19118/state/v1/metrics
  ...
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19118/
  ...
</pre>
  </li><li>
    <strong>Use the cluster controller status page</strong>:
    A status page for the cluster controller is available at the status port at
    <code>http://hostname:port/clustercontroller-status/v1/<em>&lt;clustername&gt;</em></code>.
    If <em>clustername</em> is not specified, the available clusters will be listed.
    The cluster controller leader status page will show if any nodes are operating with differing cluster state versions.
    It will also show how many data buckets are pending merging (document set reconciliation)
    due to either missing or being out of sync.
<pre>
$ <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a> service container-clustercontroller | grep HTTP
</pre>
    <p>
    With multiple cluster controllers, look at the one with a "/0" suffix in its config ID;
    it is the preferred leader.
    </p><p>
    The cluster state version is listed under the <em>SSV</em> table column.
    Divergence here usually points to host or networking issues.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2 id="cluster-state">Cluster state</h2>
<p>
Cluster and node state information is available through the
<a href="../content/api-state-rest-api.html">State Rest API</a>.
This API can also be used to set a <em>user state</em> for a node - alternatively use:
<ul>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get-cluster-state">vespa-get-cluster-state</a></li>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get-node-state">vespa-get-node-state</a></li>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-set-node-state">vespa-set-node-state</a></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Also see the cluster controller <a href="#status-pages">status page</a>.
</p><p>
State is persisted in a ZooKeeper cluster, restarting/changing a cluster controller preserves this:
<ul>
  <li>Last cluster state version number, for new cluster controller handover at restarts</li>
  <li>User states, set by operators - i.e. nodes manually set to down / maintenance</li>
</ul>
In case of state data lost, the cluster state is reset - see
<a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller</a> for implications.
</p>



<h2 id="cluster-controller-configuration">Cluster controller configuration</h2>
<p>
To configure the cluster controller, use
<a href="../reference/services-content.html#cluster-controller">services.xml</a>
and/or add
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/fleetcontroller.def">
configuration</a> under the <em>services</em> element - example:
<pre>
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;config name="vespa.config.content.fleetcontroller"&gt;
        &lt;min_time_between_new_systemstates&gt;5000&lt;/min_time_between_new_systemstates&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h2>
<p>
  Applications can have multiple clients and faces the problem of protecting clients from abuse. Use the
  <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/search/searchers/RateLimitingSearcher.html">
    RateLimitingSearcher</a> to rate limit load from each client type.
</p>



<h2 id="monitor-distance-to-ideal-state">Monitor distance to ideal state</h2>
<p>
  Refer to the <a href="../content/idealstate.html">distribution algorithm</a>.
  Use distributor <a href="#status-pages">status pages</a> to inspect state metrics,
  see <a href="../content/content-nodes.html#metrics">metrics</a>.
  <code>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</code> is the best metric to track,
  it is 0 when the cluster is balanced - a non-zero value indicates buckets out of sync.
</p>



<h2 id="cluster-configuration">Cluster configuration</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Running <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> will not change served
    configurations until <code>vespa-deploy activate</code> is run.
    <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> will warn about all config changes that require restart.
  </li><li>
    Refer to <a href="../schemas.html">schemas</a> for how to add/change/remove these.
  </li><li>
    Refer to <a href="../elastic-vespa.html">elastic Vespa</a>
    for how to add/remove capacity from a Vespa cluster, procedure below.
  </li><li>
    See <a href="../chained-components.html">chained components</a>
    for how to add or remove searchers and document processors.
  </li><li>
    Refer to the <a href="../performance/sizing-examples.html">sizing examples</a>

</ul>


<h2 id="add-or-remove-a-content-node">Add or remove a content node</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Node setup:</strong>
    Prepare the node by installing software, set up the file systems/directories
    and set <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html"><code>VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</code></a>.
    <a href="../reference/files-processes-and-ports.html#vespa-start-stop">Start</a> the node.
  </li><li>
    <strong>Modify configuration:</strong>
    Add/remove a <a href="../reference/services-content.html#node">node</a>-element in <em>services.xml</em>
    and <a href="../reference/hosts.html">hosts.xml</a>.
    Refer to <a href="../vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws.html">multinode install</a>.
    Make sure the <em>distribution-key</em> is unique.
  </li><li>
    <strong>Deploy</strong>: <a href="#monitor-distance-to-ideal-state">
    Observe metrics</a> to track progress as the cluster redistributes documents.
    Use the <a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller</a>
    to monitor the state of the cluster.
  </li><li>
    <strong>Tune performance (optional):</strong>
    Use <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/storage/src/vespa/storage/config/stor-distributormanager.def">
    maxpendingidealstateoperations</a> to tune concurrency of bucket merge operations from distributor nodes.
    Likewise, tune <a href="../reference/services-content.html#merges">merges</a> -
    concurrent merge operations per content node. The tradeoff is speed of bucket replication vs
    use of resources, which impacts the applications' regular load.
  </li><li>
    <strong>Finish:</strong>
    The cluster is done redistributing when <code>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</code>
    is zero on all distributors.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Do not remove more than <em>redundancy</em>-1 nodes at a time, to avoid data loss.
  Observe <code>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</code> to know bucket replica status,
  when zero on all distributor nodes, it is safe to remove more nodes.
  If <a href="../elastic-vespa.html#grouped-distribution">grouped distribution</a>
  is used to control bucket replicas, remove all nodes in a group
  if the redundancy settings ensure replicas in each group.
</p><p>
  To increase bucket redundancy level before taking nodes out,
  <a href="../content/content-nodes.html">retire</a> nodes.
  Again, track <code>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</code> to know when done.
  Use the <a href="../content/api-state-rest-api.html">State API</a> or
  <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-set-node-state">vespa-set-node-state</a>
  to set a node to <em>retired</em>.
  The <a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller's</a>
  status page lists node states.
</p><p>
  An alternative to increasing cluster size is building a new cluster, then migrate documents to it.
  This is supported using <a href="../content/visiting.html#data-export-import">visiting</a>.
</p><p>
  To <em>merge</em> two content clusters, add nodes to the cluster like above, considering:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../reference/services-content.html#node">distribution-keys</a> must be unique.
    Modify paths like <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/search/mycluster/n3</em> before adding the node.
  </li><li>
    Set <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html"><code>VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</code></a>, then start the node.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="add-or-remove-services-on-a-node">Add or remove services on a node</h2>
<p>
  It is possible to run multiple Vespa services on the same host.
  If changing the services on a given host,
  stop Vespa on the given host before running <code>vespa-deploy activate</code>.
  This is because the services are dynamically allocated port numbers,
  depending on what is running on the host.
  Consider if some of the services changed are used by services on other hosts.
  In that case, restart services on those hosts too. Procedure:
<ol>
  <li>Edit <em>services.xml</em> and <em>hosts.xml</em></li>
  <li>Stop Vespa on the nodes that have changes</li>
  <li>Run <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> and <code>vespa-deploy activate</code></li>
  <li>Start Vespa on the nodes that have changes</li>
</ol>
</p>



<h2 id="add-remove-modify-chains">Add/remove/modify chains</h2>
<p>
  Searcher, Document processing and Processing chains can be modified at runtime without restarts.
  Modification includes adding/removing processors in chains and changing names of chains and processors.
  Make the change and <a href="../cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploy">deploy</a>.
  Some changes require a container restart, refer to
  <a href="../document-processing.html#reconfiguring-document-processing">reconfiguring document processing</a>.

<h3 id="clean-mode">Clean mode</h3>
<p>
There has been rare occasions were we ended up with data that was internally inconsistent. This should be very rare
and has only happend once. For those circumstances it is possible to start the node in a special
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">validate_and_sanitize_docstore</a> mode.
This will do its best to clean up inconsistent data. However detecting that this is required is not an easy feat.
In order for this approach to work, all nodes must be stopped before enabling this feature.
If not the poison pill might come back as they have the same redundancy as the rest of your documents.
</p>


<h3>Constantly restarting distributor or service layer node</h3>
<p>
A broken node may end up with processes constantly restarting.
It may die during initialization due to accessing corrupt files,
or it may die when it starts receiving requests of a given type triggering a node local bug.
This is bad for distributor nodes,
as these restarts create constant ownership transfer between distributors,
causing windows where buckets are unavailable.
</p><p>
The cluster controller has functionality for detecting such nodes.
If a node restarts in a way that is not detected as a controlled shutdown, more than
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/fleetcontroller.def">
max_premature_crashes</a>,
the cluster controller will set the wanted state of this node to be down.
</p><p>
Detecting a controlled restart is currently a bit tricky.
A controlled restart is typically initiated by sending a TERM signal to the process.
Not having any other sign,
the content layer has to assume that all TERM signals are the cause of controlled shutdowns.
Thus, if the process keep being killed by kernel due to using too much memory,
this will look like controlled shutdowns to the content layer.

      Keeping index structures costs resources. Not all replicas of buckets are
      necessarily searchable, unless configured using
      <a href="../reference/services-content.html#searchable-copies">searchable-copies</a>.
      As Vespa indexes buckets on-demand, the most cost-efficient setting is 1,
      if one can tolerate temporary coverage loss during node failures.
      Note that <em>searchable-copies</em> does not apply to <a href="../streaming-search.html">streaming search</a>

  <tr id="data-retention-vs-size"><th>Data retention vs size</th>
    <td><p>
      When a document is removed, the document data is not immediately purged.
      Instead, <em>remove-entries</em> (tombstones of removed documents) are kept
      for a configurable amount of time. The default is two weeks, refer to
      <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
        pruneremoveddocumentsage</a>.
      This ensures that removed documents stay removed in a distributed system where nodes change state.
      Entries are removed periodically after expiry.
      Hence, if a node comes back up after being down for more than two weeks,
      removed documents are available again, unless the data on the node is wiped first.
      A larger <em>pruneremoveddocumentsage</em> will hence grow the storage size as this keeps
      document and tombstones longer.
    </p><p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The backend does not store remove-entries for nonexistent documents.
      This to prevent clients sending wrong document identifiers from
      filling a cluster with invalid remove-entries.
      A side-effect is that if a problem has caused all replicas of a bucket to be unavailable,
      documents in this bucket cannot be marked removed until at least one replica is available again.
      Documents are written in new bucket replicas while the others are down -
      if these are removed, then older versions of these will not re-emerge,
      as the most recent change wins.

      A cluster is typically sized to handle a given load.
      A given percentage of the cluster resources are required for normal operations,
      and the remainder is the available resources that can be used if some of the nodes are no longer usable.
      If the cluster loses enough nodes, it will be overloaded:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remaining nodes may create disk full situation.
          This will likely fail a lot of write operations, and if disk is shared with OS,
          it may also stop the node from functioning.</li>
        <li>Partition queues will grow to maximum size.
          As queues are processed in FIFO order, operations are likely to get long latencies.</li>
        <li>Many operations may time out while being processed,
          causing the operation to be resent, adding more load to the cluster.</li>
        <li>When new nodes are added, they cannot serve requests
          before data is moved to the new nodes from the already overloaded nodes.
          Moving data puts even more load on the existing nodes,
          and as moving data is typically not high priority this may never actually happen.</li>
