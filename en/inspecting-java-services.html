<p>
  Determine the state of each running Java Vespa service using JConsole.
  JConsole is distributed along with the Java developer kit.
  Start JConsole:
</p>
<pre>
$ jconsole &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  where the host and port determine which service to attach to.
  For security purposes the JConsole tool can not directly attach to Vespa services from external machines.
</p>



<h2 id="connecting-to-a-vespa-instance">Connecting to a Vespa instance</h2>
<p>
  To attach a JConsole to a Vespa service running on another host,
  create a tunnel from the JConsole host to the Vespa service host.
  This can for example be done by setting up two SSH tunnels as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ ssh -N -L&lt;port1&gt;:localhost:&lt;port1&gt; &lt;service-host&gt; &amp;
$ ssh -N -L&lt;port2&gt;:localhost:&lt;port2&gt; &lt;service-host&gt; &amp;
</pre>
<p>
  where port1 and port2 are determined by the type of service (see below).
  A JConsole can then be attached to the service as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ jconsole localhost:&lt;port1&gt;
</pre>
<p>Port numbers:</p>
<table class="table" style="width: auto">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Port 1</th>
      <th>Port 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>QRS</td>
      <td>19015</td>
      <td>19016</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Docproc</td>
      <td>19123</td>
      <td>19124</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Updated port information can be found by running:</p>
<pre>
$ <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a> service &lt;servicename&gt;
</pre>
<p>
where the resulting RMIREGISTRY and JMX lines determine port1 and port2, respectively.
</p>



<h2 id="examining-thread-states">Examining thread states</h2>
<p>
  The state of each container is available in JConsole by pressing the Threads tab
  and selecting the thread of interest in the threads list.
  Threads of interest includes <em>search</em>, <em>connector</em>, <em>closer</em>, <em>transport</em> and
  <em>acceptor</em> (the latter four are used for backend communications).
