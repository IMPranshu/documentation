title: "Ranking With nativeRank"

<p>
The <em>nativeRank</em> text match score is a reasonably good text
rank score which is computed at an acceptable performance by Vespa.
It computes a normalized rank score which tries to capture how well query
terms matched the set of searched index fields.
</p><p>
The <em>nativeRank</em> feature is computed as a linear combination of
three other matching features: <em>nativeFieldMatch</em>, <em>nativeProximity</em>
and <em>nativeAttributeMatch</em>, see <a href="reference/nativerank.html">
the nativeRank reference for details</a>.
Ranking signals that might be useful like freshness
(the age of the document compared to the time of the query)
or any other document or query features is <strong>NOT</strong> a part
of the <em>nativeRank</em> calculation and needs to be added to the
final ranking function depending on application specifics.
The <em>nativeRank</em> is a pure text match ranking function
and should be used in combination with application specific features
to produce the final rank score.
</p>



<h2 id="ranking-expressions-and-nativerank">Ranking expressions and nativeRank</h2>
<p>
Vespa allows the final rank score number to be calculated by a
configured mathematical expression
called <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">ranking expression</a>.
Ranking expressions looks like straightforward mathematical expressions
and supports the usual mathematical operators and functions
allowing the user to configure any rank function,
including usage of the <em>nativeRank</em> text matching feature.
</p><p>
The primitive values which are combined by ranking expressions are
called <strong>rank features</strong>.
The rank features are numbers which say something about the query,
the document or how well the query matched this particular document.
The query features can be sent as http query parameters or set in searchers,
the document features are the attributes
(indexing:attribute) specified in the schema,
and the match features are calculated by Vespa from the index during matching.
The <em>nativeRank</em> feature is one example of a built in match feature,
which only concerns the query/document matching.
The final rank score should also utilize other signals that are application specific,
for instance document age (freshness), quality of the document
(number of in-links in a web context, maybe ratings and reviews in social applications)
and user personalization (user age, gender etc).
See the <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank feature list</a>
for details about built-in rank-features in Vespa.
</p>



<h2 id="using-nativeRank">Using nativeRank</h2>
<p>
In this section we describe a blog search application that
uses <em>nativeRank</em> as the core text matching rank feature,
in combination with other signals that could be important for a blog search type of application:
<pre>
schema blog {
  document blog {
    field title type string {
      indexing: summary | index
    }
    field body type string {
      indexing: summary | index
    }
    #The quality of the source in the range 0 - 1.0
    field sourcequality type float {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }
    #seconds since epoch
    field timestamp type long {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }
    field url type uri {
      indexing: summary
    }
  }
  fieldset default {
    fields: title, body
  }
}
</pre>
In addition to the core text match feature (<em>nativeRank</em>)
we have a pre-calculated document feature which indicates the quality of
the document represented by the field <em>sourcequality</em> of type float.
The <em>sourcequality</em> field has
the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#attribute">attribute</a>
property which is required to refer that field in a ranking expression:
<em>attribute(name)</em>.
The sourcequality score could be calculated from webmap,
or any other source and is outside the scope of this document.
We also know when the documented was published (timestamp)
and this document attribute can be used to calculate the age of the document.
To summarize we have three main rank signals
that we would like our blog ranking function to consist of:
<ul>
<li>How well the query match the document text, where we use
    the <em>nativeRank</em> feature score</li>
<li>How fresh the document is, where we use the built-in
    <em>age(name)</em> feature to built our own feature score</li>
<li>The quality of the document, calculated outside of Vespa and
    referenced in a ranking expression by <em>attribute(name)</em></li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2 id="tuning-nativeRank">Tuning nativeRank</h2>
<p>
We tune the index field weight in the rank-profile,
this is done by the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#weight">
field weight</a> configuration parameter.
We claim that a hit in the title is more relevant then a hit in the body
so we have configured a weight of 200 for the title, and 100 (default) for the body.
There are several other <a href="reference/nativerank.html">
tuning parameters of the nativeRank feature</a>, like:
<ul>
<li>The weight of the 3 nativeRank components that nativeRank consist
    of: nativeFieldMatch, nativeProximity and
    nativeAttributeMatch</li>
<li>The shape of the boosting tables for core statistics like term
    frequency and proximity between terms in the field.</li>
<li>Per field configuration supported, can have different term
    frequency boosting (or any other of the core statistics) for text
    with different characteristics, e.g title compared to body</li>
<li>Per field <a href="reference/rank-types.html">rank-types</a> like <code>identity</code> and <code>about</code> which
are pre-configured boosting tables for different type of text fields
</li>
</ul>
<a href="reference/nativerank.html#configuration-properties">See
the comprehensive list of all the configuration properties of nativeRank</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="designing-our-own-blog-freshness-ranking-function">Designing our own blog freshness ranking function</h2>
<p>
Vespa has several <a href="reference/rank-features.html">built in
rank-features</a> that we can use directly or we can design our own as
well if the built in features doesn't meet our requirements.
The built in <em>freshness(name)</em> rank-feature is linearly decreasing from 0
age (now) to the configured max age.
Ideally we would like to have a different shape for our blog application,
we define the following feature which has the characteristic we want:
<pre>
function freshness() {
    expression: exp(-1 * age(timestamp)/(3600*12))
}
</pre>
Timestamp resolution is seconds, so we divide by 3600 to go to an
hour resolution and further we divide with 12 to control the slope of the freshness function.
Below is a plot of two freshness functions with different slope numbers for comparison:
</p>
<img src="img/relevance/blog-freshness.png" />
<p>
The beauty is that we can control and experiment with the freshness
rank score given the document age.
We can define any shape over any resolution that we think will fit the exact application requirements.
In our case we would like to have a non-linear relationship between the
age of the document and the freshness score.
We achieve this with a exponential decreasing function (exp(-x)),
where the sensitivity of x is higher when the document is really fresh
compared to a old blog post (24 hours).
</p>



<h2 id="putting-our-features-together-into-a-ranking-expression">Putting our features together into a ranking
expression</h2>
<p>
We now need to put our three main ranking signals together into one ranking expression.
We would like to control the weight of each component at query time
so we can at query time do analysis to figure out
if a certain signal should be weighted more then others.
We chose to combine our three signals into a normalized weighted sum of the three signals.
The shape of each of the three signals might be tuned individually
as we have seen with design of our own freshness feature and <em>nativeRank</em> tuning.
Below is the final blog rank-profile
with all relevant settings (properties) and ranking expressions.
<pre>
rank-profile blog inherits default {
    weight title: 200
    weight body: 100
    rank-type body: about
    rank-properties {
      $textMatchWeight: 0.4 #pre-configured weights, can be overridden at query time
      $qualityWeight: 0.3
      $deservesFreshness: 0.3
      nativeFieldMatch.occurrenceCountTable.title: &quot;linear(0,8000)&quot; #Example of nativeRank tuning, override the occurrence boost shape to be flat
    }

    # our freshness rank feature
    function freshness() {
      expression: exp(-1 * age(timestamp)/(3600*12))
    }

    # our quality rank feature
    function quality() {
      expression: attribute(sourcequality)
    }

    # normalization factor for the weighted sum
    function normalization() {
      expression: $textMatchWeight + $qualityWeight + $deservesFreshness
    }

    # ranking function that runs over all matched documents, determined by the boolean query logic
    first-phase {
      expression: (query(textMatchWeight) * (nativeRank(title,body) + query(qualityWeight) * quality +  query(deservesFreshness) * freshness))/normalization
    }

    summary-features: nativeRank(title,body) age(timestamp) freshness quality
  }
}
</pre>
We can override the weight of each signal at query time with
the <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html">query api</a>,
passing down the weights:
<pre>
/search/?query=vespa+ranking&amp;datetime=now&amp;ranking.profile=blog&amp;ranking.features.query(textMatchWeight)=0.1&amp;ranking.features.query(deservesFreshness)=0.85
</pre>
It is also possible to override these user defined rank-features in a custom searcher plugin,
note that we also use the <em>datetime</em> parameter to be able to calculate the age of the document.
</p><p>
The <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>
allows us to have access to the individual ranking signals along with the hit's summary fields.
