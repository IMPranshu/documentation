<p>
  A schema defines a <a href="documents.html">document type</a> and what we want to compute over it.
  Schemas are mapped to one or more content clusters in <a href="reference/services.html">services.xml</a>.
  These content clusters can then store and compute over data stored in the schema.
  Schemas are stored in files named the same as the schema, with the ending ".sd" (for schema definition),
  in the <code>schemas/</code> directory of the application package.
  Refer to the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html">schema reference</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Document types, rank profiles and document summaries in schemas can be <em>inherited</em>,
  see the <a href="schema-inheritance.html">schema inheritance guide</a> for examples.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Compatibility note:</strong> Schemas may also be stored in the <code>searchdefinitions/</code> directory
  and use <code>search</code> instead of <code>schema</code> as the top level tag.
  Use of searchdefinitions and search will be deprecated, use schema instead.
</p>
<p>
  Schema example:
</p>
<pre>
schema music {
    document music {
        field artist type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field artistId type string {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

        field title type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field album type string {
            indexing: index
        }

        field duration type int {
            indexing: summary
        }

        field year type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

        field popularity type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }
    }

    fieldset default {
        fields: artist, title, album
    }

    rank-profile song inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression:nativeRank(artist,title,album) + if(isNan(attribute(popularity)) == 1, 0,attribute(popularity))
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="field">field</h2>
<p>
A field has a type, like string or double - see <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#field">
field reference</a> for a full list.
</p><p>
Documents can have relations, and field values can be imported from
<a href="parent-child.html">parent documents</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="indexing">indexing</h3>
<p>
<code>indexing</code> configures how to process data of a field during indexing -
the most important ones are:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>index</code></td><td>
        For unstructured text: Create a text index for this field.
        <a href="text-matching-ranking.html">Text matching</a> and all text ranking features become available.
        Indexes are disk backed and do not need to fit in memory.
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#indexing">Reference</a> /
        <a href="proton.html#index">index details</a></td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td><code>attribute</code></td><td>
        For structured data: Keep this field in memory in a forward structure.
        This makes the field available for grouping, sorting and ranking.
        Attributes may also be searched by complete match (word or exact),
        or (for numerical fields) by range.
        Optionally a B-tree in memory can also be created by adding the fast-search option - this improves
        performance if the attribute is a strong criterion in queries (i.e filters out many documents).
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#attribute">Reference</a> /
        <a href="attributes.html">attribute details</a></td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td><code>summary</code></td><td>
        Include this field in the document summary in search result sets.
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary">Reference</a> /
        <a href="document-summaries.html">document summary details</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Indexing instructions have pipeline semantics similar to unix shell
commands, with data flowing from left to right.
They can perform complex transformations on field values,
or just send the field value unchanged to the next sections of the index structure - example:
<pre>
indexing: summary | attribute | index
</pre>
The data is first added to the document summary, then added as an
in-memory attribute and finally indexed.
The indexing language offers more functionality than this,
like filter field values, combine field values, select on different values.
Learn more in the <a href="reference/advanced-indexing-language.html">
indexing language</a> reference.
</p>


<h3 id="matching">Matching</h3>
<p>
<a href="text-matching-ranking.html">Text matching</a> describes the different ways / modes
to match queries to documents per field.
Query tracing and match configuration inspection is useful to analyze matching.
</p><p>
Make sure the query did not time out when analyzing matches.
The <a href="graceful-degradation.html#timeouts">soft timeout</a>
will return the matches found at timeout, possibly eliminating matches.
</p><p>
Ensure that the configuration of chains and providers is correct with respect to indexing.
Example: querying this provider will not lowercase / stem terms:
<pre>
&lt;provider id="myProvider" type="local" cluster="mydocs" inherits="vespa"
    excludes="com.yahoo.prelude.searcher.BlendingSearcher
              com.yahoo.prelude.querytransform.StemmingSearcher
              com.yahoo.search.querytransform.VespaLowercasingSearcher"&gt;
</pre>
In case of using multiple document types, review
<a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.restrict">restrict</a> /
<a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.sources">sources</a> settings
to make sure queries hit the right document types.


<h3 id="multivalue-fields">Multivalue fields</h3>
<p>
A field can be <em>single value</em>, like a string, or <em>multivalue</em>, like an array of strings -
see the  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#field">field type list</a>.
</p><p>
Most multivalue fields can be used in <a href="reference/grouping-syntax.html#multivalue-attributes">grouping</a>.
</p><p>
When searching in array or map of struct,
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#sameelement">sameElement()</a> is a useful query operator
to restrict matches to same struct element.
Note that the document summary will not contain which element(s) matched.
</p><p>
Accessing attributes in maps and arrays of struct in ranking is not possible.
</p><p>
The rank feature <a href="reference/rank-features.html#attribute(name).count">attribute(name).count</a>
can be used in ranking to <em>rank</em> based on number of elements in a multivalue attribute.
To <em>filter</em> based on number of elements, create a
<a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#if-function-and-string-equality-tests">strict tiering rank function</a>
combined with a <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-score-drop-limit">rank-score-drop-limit</a>.
Then use a <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#using-query-variables">query variable</a> for number of elements.
Note that doing this filtering is more expensive to evaluate than just having a separate field for the count.
</p>



<h2 id="fieldset">fieldset</h2>
<p>
A <code>fieldset</code> groups fields together for searching - example:
<pre>
search/?query=title:sometitle default:someword
</pre>
This query returns documents having <em>sometitle</em> in the field <em>title</em>,
and <em>someword</em> in one or more of the fields in the fieldset <em>default</em>.
If no field/field set name is given for a search term, the fieldset named <em>default</em> is searched.
Find details in the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#fieldset">fieldset reference</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="rank-profile">rank-profile</h2>
<p>
Vespa has built-in rank profiles, and/or such profiles can be configured,
by hand or using machine learning.
Read more in the <a href="ranking.html">ranking</a> documentation.
</p>



<h2 id="multiple-schemas">Multiple schemas</h2>

<p>Many application define multiple kinds of data - each in their own schema.
Multiple schemas can either be mapped to a single content cluster, or one
can define a separate content cluster for each schema to be able to scale differently for each kind of data.
A single container cluster can be used to query all the data types in both these configurations.</p>



<h2 id="querying-multiple-document-types">Querying multiple document types</h2>
<p>
In an application with multiple types of data, each query may decide which types are
to be searched by each query.
The details on how this works are in <a href="federation.html">federation</a>.
In summary, the following always apply:
<ul>
  <li>
    Vespa will by default query all document types and all clusters in parallel,
    and blend results based on score.
  </li><li>
    To limit the query to a subset of the types inside a content cluster,
    set <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.restrict">restrict</a>
    to a comma-separated list of schema names:
<pre>
/search/?query=lotr&amp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">restrict=music,book</span>
</pre>
  </li><li>
    To limit the query to a subset of the content clusters,
    set <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.sources">sources</a>
    to a comma-separated list of content cluster names.
<pre>
/search/?query=lotr&amp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">sources=music_cluster,book_cluster</span>
</pre>
    Both these parameters can be combined to search both a subset of types and clusters.
  </li>
</ul>
Queries are evaluated in parallel over all selected document types and all clusters.
</p>
