<p>
This document documents the changes between Vespa major versions 7 and 8.
As documented in <a href="vespa-versions.html">Vespa versions</a>,
major versions are used to mark breaking compatibility,
not to release significant new functionality (which instead happens on minor versions).
However even on major versions, compatibility is broken only in two specific ways:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Changes to defaults:</strong>
    Applications may need to set some option explicitly to preserve earlier behavior</li>
  <li><strong>Removal of deprecated functionality:</strong>
    Applications <em>which use functionality that has earlier been deprecated</em>
    need to change to keep working</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most deprecated functionality causes warning during compilation (Java API deprecations)
or deployment (application package deprecations).
With web service APIs, there is no way to emit deprecation warnings,
these are marked as deprecated in the documentation.
</p><p>
Given this, application owners need to do 3 tasks to be compatible with Vespa 8:
<ul>
  <li>Review whether <a href="#changed-defaults">changes to defaults</a>
    requires additional settings in the application</li>
  <li>Make sure there are no deprecation warnings on compilation and deployment on Vespa 7</li>
  <li>Review the list of removed web service API's and API parameters
    and make sure these are not used by clients of the application</li>
</ul>
<p>
As Vespa 8 does not introduce new functionality,
it is as safe and mature as the versions of Vespa 7 preceding it.
Upon release of Vespa 8, no further releases will be made of Vespa 7 for any reason.
</p><p>
The following sections lists the changes on moving from Vespa 7 to Vespa 8
which must be reviewed by applications.
</p>



<h2 id="changed-defaults">Changed defaults</h2>
<p>
The following defaults have changed:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Change</th><th>Configuration required to avoid change on Vespa 8</th>

<!--
<h2 id="jdk-version">JDK version</h2>
<p>
Java components must be rebuilt with JDK 11 for the Vespa bundle-plugin
to generate the correct set of imported packages for your OSGi bundles.
</p>
-->



<h2 id="removed-java-apis">Removed Java APIs</h2>
<p>
Classes and methods that were marked as deprecated in Vespa 7 are removed.
If deprecation warnings are emitted for Vespa API's when building the application,
these must be fixed before migrating to Vespa 8.
</p>



<!--
<h2 id="container-runtime">Container Runtime Environment</h2>
<p>
The following maven artifacts are no longer provided runtime:
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
If of these dependencies are required,
they must be embedded in the app's bundle by adding them in scope <em>compile</em> in pom.xml.

<h2 id="vespa-dispatch-bin-process-is-removed">vespa-dispatch-bin process is removed</h2>
<p>
The dispatch feature is moved into the Vespa Container
and the <em>vespa-dispatch-bin</em> process is removed.
As this is not a public interface,
the default was switched to <strong>not</strong> using vespa-dispatch-bin in Vespa-7.109.10.
The process was removed in subsequent Vespa releases:
<table class="table">
<tr>
  <td><a href="query-api.html">Dispatch</a></td>
  <td>Content cluster</td>
  <td>dynamically allocated in 19100 - 19899 range</td>
  <td>$VESPA_HOME/sbin/vespa-dispatch-bin</td>
  <td>Dispatcher, communicates between container and content nodes.
    Can be multi-level in a hierarchy</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Rolling upgrade note: A rolling upgrade over Vespa-7.109.10 should work with no extra steps.
