<p>
  The JDisc container uses <a href="https://osgi.org">OSGi</a> to provide a modular platform
  for developing applications that can be composed of many reusable components.
  The user can deploy, upgrade and remove these components at runtime.
</p>



<h2 id="what-is-osgi">What is OSGi?</h2>
<p>
  OSGi is a framework for modular development of Java applications, where a
  set of resources called <em>bundles</em> can be installed. OSGi allows the developer to
  control which resources (Java packages) in a bundle that should be available to
  other bundles. Hence, you can explicitly declare a bundle's public API,
  and also ensure that internal implementation details remain hidden.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you're already familiar with OSGi, we recommend reading Richard S. Hall's presentation
  <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/7956/Learning_to_ignore_OSGi.pdf">Learning
    to ignore OSGi</a>, which explains the most important aspects that you must relate to as a bundle
  developer. There are other good OSGi tutorials available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thiloshon.wordpress.com/2020/03/04/osgi-for-dummies/">OSGi for Dummies</a> </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/OSGi/article.html">OSGi Modularity and Services - Tutorial</a>
    (You can ignore the part about OSGi services.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  JDisc uses OSGi's <em>module</em> and <em>lifecycle</em> layers, and does not provide any functionality
  from the <em>service</em> layer.
</p>



<h2 id="typical-bundle">What is an OSGi bundle?</h2>
<p>
  An OSGi bundle is a regular JAR file with a MANIFEST.MF file that describes its content,
  what the bundle requires (imports) from other bundles, and what it provides (exports) to other
  bundles. Below is an example of a typical bundle manifest with the most important headers:
</p>
<pre>
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.yahoo.helloworld
Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Export-Package: com.yahoo.helloworld;version="1.0.0"
Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version="1.3.0"
</pre>
<p>
  The meaning of the headers in this bundle manifest is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Bundle-SymbolicName</code> - The unique identifier of the bundle.</li>
  <li><code>Bundle-Description</code> - A human-readable description of the bundle's
    functionality.</li>
  <li><code>Bundle-Version</code> - Designates a version number to the
    bundle.</li>
  <li><code>Export-Package</code> - Expresses which Java packages contained
    in a bundle will be made available to the outside world.</li>
  <li><code>Import-Package</code> - Indicates which Java packages will be
    required from the outside world to fulfill the dependencies needed in a
    bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that OSGi has a strict definition of version numbers that need to
  be followed for bundles to work correctly.  See the
  <a href="https://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/framework/Version.html#Version(java.lang.String)">OSGi
    javadoc</a> for details. As a general advice, never use more than three numbers
  in the version (major, minor, micro).
</p>



<h2>Building an OSGi bundle</h2>
<p>
  As long as the project was created by following steps in the
  <a href="../developer-guide.html">Developer Guide</a>,
  the code is already being packaged into an OSGi bundle by the
  <a href="../bundle-plugin.html">Maven bundle plugin</a>.
  However, if migrating an existing Maven project, change the packaging statement to:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;packaging&gt;container-plugin&lt;/packaging&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  and add the plugin to the build instructions:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.yahoo.vespa&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;bundle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;7.25.26&lt;/version&gt; &lt;!-- Find latest version at <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.yahoo.vespa%20a:bundle-plugin">search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.yahoo.vespa%20a:bundle-plugin</a> --&gt;
    &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Because OSGi introduces a different runtime environment from what Maven
  provides when running unit tests, one will not observe any loading and
  linking errors until trying to deploy the application onto a running
  JDisc Container.
  Errors triggered at this stage will be the likes of
  <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> and <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>. To debug
  these types of errors, you need to inspect the stack traces in the <a
        href="../reference/logs.html">error log</a>, and refer to the <a
        href="bundle-troubleshooting.html">bundle troubleshooting</a> document
</p><p>
  <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-logfmt">vespa-logfmt</a>
  with its <em>--nldequote</em> option is useful when reading logs.
</p>
<p>
  The test suite needs to cover deployment of the application bundle to
  ensure that its dynamic loading and linking issues are covered.
</p>



<h2>Depending on non-OSGi ready libraries</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately, many popular Java libraries have yet to be bundled with the
  appropriate manifest that makes them OSGi-compatible.
  The simplest solution to this is to set the scope of the problematic
  dependency to <strong>compile</strong> in your pom.xml file. This will cause the bundle
  plugin to package the whole library into your bundle's JAR file. Until the
  offending library becomes available as an OSGi bundle, it means that your
  bundle will be bigger (in number of bytes), and that classes of that
  library can not be shared across application bundles.
</p>
<p>
  The practical implication of this feature is that the bundle plugin
  copies the compile-scoped dependency, and its transitive dependencies,
  into the final JAR file, and adds
  a <code>Bundle-ClassPath</code> instruction to its manifest that
  references those dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  Although this approach works for most non-OSGi libraries, it only works for
  libraries where the jar file is <em>self contained</em>. If, on the other hand, the
  library depends on other installed files, it must be treated as if it was a
  <a href="#depending-on-JNI-libraries">JNI library</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="depending-on-JNI-libraries">Depending on JNI Libraries</h2>
<p>
  This section details alternatives for using native code in the container.
</p>


<h3>OSGi bundles containing native code</h3>
<p>
  OSGi jars may contain .so files, which can be loaded in the standard way from Java
  code in the bundle. Note that since only one instance of an .so can be loaded at any time,
  it is not possible to hot swap a jar containing .so files - when such jars are changed
  the <a href="container-components.html#JNI-requires-restart">new configuration will not
  take effect until the container is restarted</a>.
  Therefore, it is often a good idea to package a .so file and its Java API
  into a separate bundle from the rest of your code to avoid having to restart the container on all code changes.
</p>


<h3>Add JNI code to the global classpath</h3>
<p>
  When the JNI dependency cannot be packaged in a bundle,
  and you run on an environment where you can install files locally
  on the container nodes,
  you can add the dependency to the container's classpath and explicitly
  export the packages to make them visible to OSGi bundles.
</p>
<p>
  Add the following configuration in the top level <em>services</em>
  element in <a href="../reference/services-container.html">services.xml</a>:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;		
    &lt;config name="search.config.qr-start"&gt;		
        &lt;container&gt;		
            &lt;classpath_extra&gt;/lib/jars/foo.jar:/path/bar.jar&lt;/classpath_extra&gt;		
            &lt;export_packages&gt;com.foo,com.bar&lt;/export_packages&gt;		
        &lt;/container&gt;		
    &lt;/config&gt;		
    ...		
&lt;/services&gt;		
</pre>		
<p>
  Adding the config at the top level ensures that it's applied to all jdisc clusters.
</p>
<p>
  The packages are now available and visible,
  but they must still be imported by the application bundle that uses the library.
  Here is how to configure the bundle plugin to enforce an import of the packages to the bundle:
</p>
<pre>		
&lt;plugin&gt;		
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.yahoo.vespa&lt;/groupId&gt;		
  &lt;artifactId&gt;bundle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;		
  &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;		
  <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;importPackage&gt;com.foo,com.bar&lt;/importPackage&gt;		
  &lt;/configuration&gt;</span>		
&lt;/plugin&gt;		
</pre>
<p>
  When adding a library to the classpath it becomes globally visible, and
  exempt from the package visibility management of OSGi.
  If another bundle contains the same library, there will be class loading issues.
</p>
