<p>
This document explains how to build chains programmatically by using
the <em>chain builder</em>. Before proceeding, we should be familiar
with the fundamental <a href="../chained-components.html">chain concepts</a>.
Building a chain programmatically means that we do not use <em>services.xml</em> to configure the
chain and its components. Instead, we build a chain directly from Java code. This
is useful for testing.
<p>


<h2 id="building-a-chain">Building a Chain</h2>
<p>
Let us try to build a simple chain of components. For this example, we
call our components <em>filters</em>. What they do is not important -
what matters is that all filter classes have a common
baseclass. First, we define the baseclass and two implementations,
<code>FilterA</code> and <code>FilterB</code>:
<pre class="brush: java">
    static class Filter {}
    static class FilterA extends Filter {}
    static class FilterB extends Filter {}

    Filter a = new FilterA();
    Filter b = new FilterB();
</pre>
<p>
To make the following examples clearer, we will use this helper function to obtain a new
chain builder for a chain that will be named "myChain":
<pre class="brush: java">
    private ChainBuilder&lt;Filter&gt; newChain() {
        return new ChainBuilder&lt;&gt;("myChain");
    }
</pre>
Now, let's build a chain where filter <code>a</code> is placed before
filter <code>b</code>:
<pre class="brush: java">
    Chain&lt;Filter&gt; chain = newChain().
            add(a, before(b)).
            add(b).
            build();
</pre>
<p>
Or, alternatively:
<pre class="brush: java">
    Chain&lt;Filter&gt; chain = newChain().
            add(a).
            add(b, after(a)).
            build();
</pre>
The statements <code>before(b)</code> and <code>after(a)</code> are
calls to static methods in a class called <code>Dependencies</code>,
so we need to import those. Here is a fully working example:
<pre class="brush: java">
import static com.yahoo.yolean.chain.Dependencies.after;
import static com.yahoo.yolean.chain.Dependencies.before;

class MyChainTest {
    static class Filter {}
    static class FilterA extends Filter {}
    static class FilterB extends Filter {}

    Chain&lt;Filter&gt; getMyChain()
        Filter a = new FilterA();
        Filter b = new FilterB();

        return new ChainBuilder&lt;&gt;("myChain").
                add(a, before(b)).
                add(b).
                build();
    }
}
</pre>


<h2>Adding Dependencies</h2>
<p>
Above, we added components to the chain using the <code>add</code>
method. Let's take a closer look at how that method is defined:
<pre class="brush: java">
  public final ChainBuilder&lt;T&gt; add(T component, Dependencies&lt;? extends T&gt;... dependencies)
</pre>
<p>
As we can see, the builder itself is returned, allowing us to chain
the <code>add</code> calls. But the most interesting part is its parameters:
<ol>
  <li>the component itself
  <li>one or more <code>Dependencies</code>
</ol>
<p>
Each 'Dependencies' object represents an ordering constraint that
applies to the component. Remember, there are three <a
 href="../chained-components.html">dependency
types</a>, and the <code>Dependencies</code> class provides methods for each
of them:
<p>
<dl>
  
<dt>provides</dt>
<dd>Takes a varargs of string labels. Example:
<pre class="brush: java">
  provides("removeExplicitLanguage", "familyFilter");
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>before</dt>
<dd>Three separate methods allow adding 'before' constraints. Each
  method takes a
  varargs of one of the following: component 
  <em>instances</em>, component <em>classes</em>, or string labels
  (something that another component <em>provides</em>). Examples:
<pre class="brush: java">
  before(finalFilter, penultimateFilter, &hellip;);
  before(FinalFilter.class, PenultimateFilter.class, &hellip;);
  before("final", "penultimate", &hellip;);
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>after</dt>
<dd>Just like 'before', there are separate methods that take either a
  varargs of component <em>instances</em>, component <em>classes</em>, or
  string labels (something that another component
  <em>provides</em>). Examples:
<pre class="brush: java">
  after(firstFilter, secondFilter, &hellip;);
  after(FirstFilter.class, SecondFilter.class, &hellip;);
  after("first", "second", &hellip;);
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Hence, a more complex example of building a chain can look like
this:
<pre class="brush: java">
    Chain&lt;Filter&gt; chain = newChain().
            add(firstFilter, provides("first"), before(secondFilter, finalFilter)).
            add(secondFilter, provides("second"), after("first")).
            add(penultimateFilter, after("first", "second")).
            add(finalFilter, after(SecondFilter.class, PenultimateFilter.class)).
            build();
</pre>
<p>
Note that most of these constraints are only added for sake of the
example. We could, of course, have obtained the same ordering by using
only a few of them.


<h3>Subclasses</h3>
<p>
If a component has a before/after dependency on a class, it also has
the same dependency on all its subclasses. Consider the following
example, where component <code>a</code> is said to be before all
instances of class <code>FilterB</code>. This also means that
component <code>a</code> will be placed before all instances of the
subclass <code>ExtendsFilterB</code>.
<pre class="brush: java">
    static class FilterA extends Filter {}
    static class FilterB extends Filter {}
    static class ExtendsFilterB extends FilterB {}

    Filter a = new FilterA();
    Filter b = new ExtendsFilterB();

    Chain&lt;Filter&gt; chain = newChain().
                add(a, before(FilterB.class)).
                add(b).
                build();
</pre>



<h3>Annotation dependencies</h3>
<p>
In addition to the dependencies given programmatically, the chain
builder also honors any <a href="../chained-components.html">dependency
annotations</a> that are given in the implementation classes.
Any conflicts across these dependencies will also be detected by the builder.
</p>
