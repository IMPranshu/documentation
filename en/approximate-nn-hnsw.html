title: "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search using HNSW Index"
---
<p>For an introduction to nearest neighbor search see
<a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">Nearest Neighbor Search</a> documentation.
This document describes how to speed up searches for nearest neighbors by adding a
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#index-hnsw">HNSW index</a> to the tensor field.
Vespa implements a modified version of
the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs algorithm (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">paper</a>).
The implementation in Vespa supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Data Filtering</strong> - The search for nearest neighbors can be constrained by query filters
as the nearest neighbor search in Vespa is expressed as a query operator.
This can be combined with other filters or query terms using the
<a href="query-language.html">Vespa query language</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Real Time Indexing</strong> - Add, remove and update vectors in the index with low latency,
using the <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor">document JSON format for tensors</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mutable HNSW Index</strong> - This ensures no query overhead from having to search multiple <em>HNSW</em> indexes.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded Indexing</strong> - The costly part when doing changes to the index is searching the graph layers
to find which parts to change. This is handled by multiple threads, controlled by the
<a href="reference/services-content.html#feeding-concurrency">feeding concurrency</a> setting.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded Searching</strong> - Several threads can be used per query.
See
<a href="performance/sizing-search.html#scaling-latency">Scaling latency in a content group</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-vespas-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search">Using Vespa's approximate nearest neighbor search</h2>
<p>
The query examples in <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> uses the brute force variant which has
perfect accuracy but which is computationally expensive for large document volumes
as the distance needs to be calculated for every document which matches
the query filters in the query.

To enable fast approximate matching we need to alter our document schema and add an <em>index</em> section to our tensor definitions.
The same document type can have multiple <em>HNSW</em> indexes (one per tensor field):</p>
<pre>
field image_sift_encoding type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[128]) {
  indexing: summary | attribute | index
  attribute {
    distance-metric: euclidean 
  }
  index {
    hnsw {
      max-links-per-node: 16
      neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 500
    }
  }
}

field title_bert_embedding type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[768]) {
  indexing: summary | attribute | index
  attribute {
    distance-metric: angular
  }
  index {
    hnsw {
      max-links-per-node: 24
      neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 500
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>In the example above we enable fast approximate search by building an <em>HNSW</em> index over the
<em>image_sift_encoding</em> and the <em>title_bert_embedding</em> tensor fields.
We use different
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">distance-metric</a>
and <em>max-links-per-node</em> settings for the two tensor fields.
See <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#index-hnsw">HNSW index reference</a> for details on the index parameters.
Choosing the value of these parameters affects both accuracy, query speed and also indexing performance.</p>

<p>The tensors used in queries must have their type declared in a query profile in the application package:
  See <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#query-feature-types">query feature types</a>.</p>


<h3 id="approximate-nearest-neighbor-query">Using fast approximate nearest neighbor search in query</h3>

<p>With an <em>HNSW</em> index enabled on the tensor field we can chose if we want to use approximate
or exact matching by using the <em>approximate</em> annotation:</p>

<pre>
{
  "yql": "select title,price from sources * where ([{\"targetHits\": 10, \"approximate\":false}]nearestNeighbor(image_sift_encoding,query_vector_sift)) and in_stock = true;",
  "hits": 100
  "ranking.features.query(query_vector_sift): [0.21,0.12,....],
  "ranking.profile": "image_similarity" 
}
</pre>
<p>By default, <em>approximate</em> is true when searching a tensor with a <em>HNSW</em> index.
The <em>approximate</em> parameter allows us to compute the accuracy loss
by having the ability to compute the exact neighbors and compare with the approximation to compute the recall@k.
In addition to <em>targetHits</em>, there is a <em>hnsw.exploreAdditionalHits</em> parameter
which controls how many extra nodes in the graph (in addition to <em>targetHits</em>)
that should be explored before selecting the best closest k hits.
Using a greater number gives better quality (accuracy as compared with the brute force) but worse performance.

<pre>
{
  "yql": "select title,price from sources * where ([{\"targetHits\": 10, \"hnsw.exploreAdditionalHits\":100}]nearestNeighbor(image_sift_encoding,query_vector_sift)) and in_stock = true;
  "hits": 100
  "ranking.features.query(query_vector_sift): [0.21,0.12,....],
  "ranking.profile": "image_similarity" 
}
</pre>


<h2 id="nearest-neighbor-search-considerations">Nearest Neighbor Search Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#nearestneighbor">nearestNeighbor</a>
operator the total hit count is not accurate.
This is similar to the behavior with
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd</a> and
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand</a>.
This is true for both approximate and brute force.</li>
<li>When using the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#nearestneighbor">nearestNeighbor</a>
operator the <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a> count is not accurate. </li>
<li>Changing the
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">distance-metric</a>
for a tensor field with an <em>HNSW</em> index requires
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#changes-that-require-restart-but-not-re-feed">re-starting</a>.
Similar, changing the <em>max-links-per-node</em> and <em>neighbors-to-explore-at-insert</em> requires re-starting.</li>
<li>Vespa tensor fields are in-memory data structures and so is the HNSW index.
For large datasets the primary memory footprint driver is the raw tensor field.</li>
</ul>
