<p>
Slobrok is an acronym for <em>Service Location Broker</em>,
and it is a name service used in Vespa.
The service listens on a specific port. Use
<a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a>
to find the <code>Slobrok</code> service's port number.
</p><p>
Clients, like the <a href="api.html">Document API</a>,
will do lookups on any of the service location broker nodes.
The Slobrok process looks like:
<pre>
$ ps ax | grep vespa-slobrok
93906  ??  SJ     2:31.52 $VESPA_HOME/sbin/vespa-slobrok -p 19100 -c slobrok.0
</pre>
Slobrok is running on the administration node as well as one or two other random nodes for redundancy.
As the service requires minimal system resources,
it does not impact other services running on the same node.
</p>
